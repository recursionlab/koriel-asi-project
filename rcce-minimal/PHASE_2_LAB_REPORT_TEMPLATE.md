## METRIC FORMULAS (Corrected)

### RC (Coherence) - Proper Triple:
```python
def compute_rc_proper(embeddings, graph_features, value_readout, weights):
    embed_term = coherence_measure(embeddings) * weights[0]
    graph_term = coherence_measure(graph_features) * weights[1] 
    value_term = coherence_measure(value_readout) * weights[2]
    return (embed_term + graph_term + value_term) / sum(weights)
```

### Drift & dDrift:
```python
D_t = KL(a_t || a_{t-1})
dD_t = (D_{t+1} - D_{t-1}) / 2  # Centered difference
```

### Energy E:
```python
E_t = moving_variance(loss, half_life=tau)
```

### Ξ-Certificate:
```python
delta = norm(psi - Xi(psi))
certificate = (delta < epsilon) AND (RC_up) AND (E_down) AND (Upsilon_band) AND (phi33_clean)
```

## FALSIFICATION RESISTANCE

### TDD Tests Required:
