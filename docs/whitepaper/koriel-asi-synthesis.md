# Koriel ASI — Category-Theoretic Architecture and Safety Synthesis

## 1) ABSTRACT
Koriel ASI organizes planning, execution, verification, memory, safety, and semantics via categorical structure and fixed-point laws. Objects are states/contexts; morphisms are controlled transformations; functors transfer models; adjunctions compress search; sheaves glue local contexts; quasicategories support homotopy-safe composition; Kleene’s SRT governs self-modification; autopoiesis enforces operational closure. We map these to system components and define contracts for: (i) adjunction triangle identities at the Planner–Actor boundary, (ii) a sheaf-descent verifier, (iii) an SRT proof-carrying update policy tied to closure witnesses, (iv) a HOAS planner DSL, and (v) transitional-topology drift alarms.

## 3) SYNTHESIS
Objects = states/contexts/types. Morphisms = policy/program transforms. Functors preserve structure; natural transformations are protocol upgrades. Adjunction (F ⊣ G) = Plan ⊣ Execute with triangle laws. Monads (T=GF) encode iterate–refine. Sheaves over a site enforce local-to-global consistency. Quasicategories provide homotopy-safe composition. SRT gives self-referential fixed points. Autopoietic closure restricts effects to allowlisted constructors.

## 4) SYSTEM MAPPING
- Planner (F): left adjoint; unit-driven search contraction.
- Actor (G): right adjoint executor; counit minimality.
- Verifier: sheaf/Čech descent gate on covers.
- Memory: site with versioned sections; pullback-preserving updates.
- Safety: autopoietic closure + allowlists; proof-carrying self-mods (SRT).
- Semantics: quasicategorical/∞-topos layer; homotopy-stable goals.
- Monitoring: transitional topology drift features and phase covers.

## 5) INTERFACES AND CONTRACTS
Canonical contracts live under `docs/contracts/` and `docs/policy/` and `docs/dsl/` and `docs/monitoring/`.

## 6) EVALUATION DESIGN
- Adjoint compression: unit/counit rewrites; assert non-inferior success and reduced expansions.
- Descent soundness: identity cover passes; engineered mismatch produces countercover witness.
- SRT guard: reject updates lacking proofs/closure witness; accept with proof and verify `U(p*) = Φ(p*)`.
- HOAS adequacy: adversarial binding cases show zero capture.
- Homotopy robustness: refactor-equivalent plans preserve outcomes.
- Phase alarms: synthetic drift transitions trigger expected phase and diagnostics.

## 7) SAFETY & GOVERNANCE
Threats: prompt injection, reflection escape, illicit global valuations, runaway composition, phase-shift blind spots.
Controls: kill-switch, allowlists, quotas, site-scoped redaction, audit trails (naturality witnesses), SRT fixed-point wrapper, descent gate before global commits.

## 8) NEXT STEPS
- Formalize acceptance test suites for contracts under `docs/contracts/`.
- Implement small reference checkers: sheaf-descent verifier (toy category), adjunction residual checker, SRT proof checker stub.
- Add monitoring scripts to compute drift features on sample data and generate phase alarms.
