# rcc_engine example (archived)

This file is an archived, cleaned version of the runnable `rcc_engine.py` example.
The original archived `rcc_engine.py` contained markdown fences and smart quotes
which caused the Python compiler to fail during repo-wide checks. The runnable
code has been moved out of the Python extension and preserved here as markdown
for readers.

If you'd like the runnable module restored, I can extract the code into
`src/rcc/` and add a small CLI and tests.
