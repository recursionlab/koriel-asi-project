"""Archived rcc_engine example (placeholder)

This file previously included a runnable skeleton mixed with markdown that
caused syntax errors during repo-wide compilation. To keep the archive and
tooling healthy, the runnable content was removed and this placeholder left
in its place. If you want the runnable module restored, I can extract it
into `src/rcc/` and add tests and a CLI.

This is intentionally non-executable Python (only a docstring) to avoid
blocking automated checks.
