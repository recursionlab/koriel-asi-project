# Dependabot remediation plan (draft)

Repository automated scanner reported: 1 moderate vulnerability on `origin/main`.

Suggested steps:

1. Identify the affected package (see GitHub Security > Dependabot alerts).
2. Attempt to upgrade to the nearest non-vulnerable version in `requirements.txt`.
   - Example: `pip install 'package>=x.y.z'` and update `requirements.txt`.
3. Run test suite locally: `pytest -q`.
4. Open a PR with the dependency bump and reference this doc.
5. If upgrade is not possible, consider patching or adding a mitigations note in the CHANGELOG.

Suggested PR description template:

```
Fix: bump <package> from <old> to <new> to address Dependabot moderate vulnerability.

Testing:
- ruff: run
- pytest: run (all tests pass)

Notes:
- If this causes incompatibilities, revert and assess backport or patch strategy.
```

I will not open the PR automatically; confirm and I will create a branch + PR with the bump.
