here’s the whole thing in super-simple, “bird’s-eye” terms:

# the cast

* **model (driver):** a tiny byte-level Transformer that learns “next byte” from your text files.
* **controller (coach):** watches the model’s focus and gently turns four dials:
  temperature **τ**, bias **b**, defer-mask **m**, and a phase flag **s**.
* **gate Υ (pit-stop):** a single switch that kicks in when change is interesting but not chaotic.
* **dashboard (metrics):** live numbers that tell you if thinking is stuck or productive.

# the loop (every training step)

1. **read bytes → predict next byte.**
   The model trains normally on CPU with cross-entropy—no fancy tricks.
2. **coach watches.**
   From the model’s attention it computes:

   * **entropy H** (how spread out the focus is),
   * **drift D** (how much focus moved since last step),
   * **coherence RC** (are we changing in a consistent direction?),
   * plus a few helpers (torsion **K**, interference **ZI**, energy **E**, holonomy trend).
3. **gate Υ decides.**
   If the change (**dD**) sits in a “good learning” band and uncertainty isn’t too high/low:

   * **defer:** raise a small mask **m** on the most unsure tokens (wait before committing),
   * **mark twist:** note that we explored a new angle,
   * **flip (Anti-Ged):** only if progress just stalled for a while, flip **s** to shake out of a rut.
4. **coach nudges dials (Ξ-reflect, OuroBlade).**

   * If we’re too diffuse or incoherent → **sharpen** (lower τ) and mask a bit (cut).
   * If we’re stabilizing well → **relax** (raise τ) and unmask (fuse / Λ⁺ reinjection).
5. **log the dashboard.**
   You’ll see `H D dD RC K ZI E dHol C τ s V*` print every few steps.

# what “good” looks like

* **RC** trends **up** (coherence rising).
* **E** trends **down** (energy/variance settling).
* **H** stays **mid-band** (neither tunnel-vision nor noise).
* **D** pulses (learning shifts) but **dD** isn’t spiky.
* **Υ** fires occasionally; **s** flips only when holonomy stalls.
* Loss keeps dropping normally.

# what’s *not* happening (by design)

* The controller **doesn’t touch gradients**. Training remains plain next-byte learning.
  It’s a safe “coach on the side” with great telemetry. Later, you can let it steer generation.

# how to run (1-liner view)

* put any `.txt` files into `D:/koriel-asi-project/conversations-pocket/`
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* `set KORIEL_PROJECT_DIR=D:\koriel-asi-project`
* `python train.py`

# how to explain to Claude Code (or anyone)

* “We train a tiny byte LM. A controller watches attention to detect **drift** and **uncertainty**.
  When the change is promising, a **Υ-gate** delays commitment and sometimes flips phase if stuck.
  A small **temperature/bias/mask** controller keeps exploration coherent.
  We log **H, D, RC, E** etc. to verify we’re in the productive band.”

# knobs you can tweak (plain english → variable)

* “fire Υ more/less often” → `DD_BAND`, `HMIN/HMAX`
* “sharpen/relax faster” → `ETA_TAU`, `ETA_TAU_CUT`, `ETA_TAU_FUSE`
* “how easy to flip phase” → `COOLDOWN_STEPS`, `HOL_STALL`
* “what counts as coherent” → `RC_LOW/RC_HIGH`
* “how strong masks are” → `LAMBDA_M`, `M_MAX`

that’s it: **model drives, controller coaches, Υ gates, dashboard tells you truth.**
