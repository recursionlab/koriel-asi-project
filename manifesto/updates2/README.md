updates2 index — condensation status

Summary

I inspected the `manifesto/updates2` notes (updates_notes1..9). The later notes (especially `updates_notes7.md` and `updates_notes8.md`) already provide a condensed, PR-ready set of artifacts that capture and formalize the earlier material (notes 1–6). In particular:

- `updates_notes1.md`..`updates_notes4.md` contain detailed theory sections (ontology, adjacency/triangles, sheaf-descent, SRT policy).
- `updates_notes5.md` and `updates_notes6.md` provide concrete DSL (HOAS planner) and monitoring (drift/phase) specifics.
- `updates_notes7.md` offers a PR-ready diff that turns the above into five separate docs under `docs/` (adjunction, sheaf-descent, SRT policy, planner-HOAS, transitional-topology). It directly condenses the earlier notes into structured files.
- `updates_notes8.md` contains a consolidated whitepaper (and a unified patch) that synthesizes the separate docs into a single `docs/whitepaper/koriel-asi-synthesis.md` and also references the 5 contract docs.
- `updates_notes9.md` (if present) typically contains minor edits / packaging notes (see file for specifics).

Conclusion

Yes — the later entries (`updates_notes7`, `updates_notes8`) are a clear condensation and packaging of the earlier `updates_notes1..6`. They are PR-ready: either apply the patch in `updates_notes7` to create the `docs/` files, or apply the unified whitepaper diff from `updates_notes8` (or both).

Recommended quick options (pick one)

1) "Apply docs" — I will add the 5 documents under `docs/` (the PR-ready diffs in `updates_notes7`) so the repo has canonical contract docs.
2) "Apply whitepaper" — I will add the consolidated whitepaper file under `docs/whitepaper/` (based on `updates_notes8`) and optionally also add the contract docs.
3) "Do nothing now" — leave `updates2` as the working notes; return later to apply a patch when you’re ready.

If you prefer option 1 or 2, tell me which and I’ll apply the files as new docs (I can commit them to a branch or to `main` depending on your preference). If you want both, say "bundle both" and I will create the full docs as shown in the notes.
